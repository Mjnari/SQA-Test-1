/*
PP 1.6: In the language of your choice, write a method that modifies a string using the following rules:

1. Each word in the input string is replaced with the following: the first letter of the word, the count of
distinct letters between the first and last letter, and the last letter of the word. For example,
â€œAutomotive parts" would be replaced by "A6e p3s".

2. A "word" is defined as a sequence of alphabetic characters, delimited by any non-alphabetic
characters.

3. Any non-alphabetic character in the input string should appear in the output string in its original
relative location.
We are looking for accuracy, efficiency and solution completeness. Please include this problem
description in the comment at the top of your solution. The problem is designed to take approximately
1-2 hours.
